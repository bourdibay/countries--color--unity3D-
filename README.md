countries--color--unity3D-
==========================

A little game made with Unity3D and [Orthello2D](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/95827-Orthello-2D-Framework-100-FREE)

The goal is to click on the color of the country's flag specified at the top of the screen during a limited time.

The project's aim was to test a very (very very) basic pathfinding feature for another game.
